Autumn in Fulufjällets National park in western Sweden.
[Fulufjällets national park](http://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/fulufjallet) on the border with Norway is a great location for a weekend away in nature.  The place is charming with vast meadows, forests, lakes, streams, mountains and idyllic houses. [Fulufjället](http://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/fulufjallet) is known for its well preserved primeval forests, wildlife and unique geology. Fulufjället is also home to Sweden's highest waterfall; [Njupeskär](https://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/en/choose-park---list/fulufjallet-national-park/seeing-and-doing/njupeskar---swedens-highest-waterfall/) falls and oldest tree; Old Tjikko. The location is also popular for winter activities such as skiing, snowmobiling and ice climbing on the Njupeskär falls. The park has an attractive and informative visitor centre ([naturum](http://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/en/choose-park---list/fulufjallet-national-park/visitor-information/visitor-centre/)) with user information including maps and guides. The park has wind shelters and camping sites. Part of the national park is located in Norway.

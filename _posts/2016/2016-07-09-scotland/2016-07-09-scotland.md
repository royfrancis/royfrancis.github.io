This spring, I decided to explore Scotland in a one-week trip. April-May is still a bit too early in the season, but I was able to experience all sorts of weather from sun to rain to snow and wind before the tourist season.

Here is a route map:

Scotland is just stunningly beautiful. It has possibly some of the most spectacular landscapes in the world. Skye is just so dramatic in landscapes and weather patterns. I experienced snow and warm sunny weather on the same day in different parts of the island. We were able to visit the Talisker distillery, Fairy pools and Kilt rock, but missed Old man of Storr and many other attractions. I had limited time on Skye, but Skye has so much to offer. One could spend an entire holiday just exploring Skye.

Driving is a pleasure in Scotland due to the much reduced traffic at least compared to England. On mainland Scotland, major roads and highways are large and wide and well maintained. Smaller roads may be narrow with two-way traffic and not so well maintained. On Skye, all roads are narrow. Driving on Skye really tests your ability to keep the vehicle perfectly in a lane that is just as wide as the vehicle while driving 50-60 mph (80-90 kph). If driving from Skye towards Inverness and you have extra time, I can recommend the [Church Road route](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/57.2831655,-5.714772/57.3466602,-5.5584417/@57.314058,-5.702834,13050m/am=t/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!4m4!2m1!1b1!3e0!5i1) offering some stunning views.

The only location I travelled north of Inverness was the [Dunrobin castle](http://www.dunrobincastle.co.uk/) in Golspie. It was in good time for the [falconry ](http://www.dunrobincastle.co.uk/falconry/index.htm)session which was pretty exciting.

As far as wildlife goes, we spotted occasional deers along the road and seals along the harbour in Inverness. We were not lucky enough to spot eagles, whales or puffins. There is a lot more to be discovered in Scotland and I hope to return at some point.

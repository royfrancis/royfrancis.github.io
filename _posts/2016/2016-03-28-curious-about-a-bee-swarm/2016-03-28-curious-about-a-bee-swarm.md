A few years back, my advisor and myself came across a honey bee swarm on the young apple trees in the backyard. It was a nice bright summer day and the flowers were in full bloom. We decided to get some empty hives and give them a home before the swarm went around and ruined people's day. My contribution was very little in the this whole activity. I had a camera and so I went around shooting videos and taking pictures. As a little Easter project, I decided to put together the footage lying around from that day. Happy Easter!

It was mostly visiting relatives, excessive eating and dealing with heat, humidity and traffic. On the bright side, the ayurvedic massages can be quite relaxing. This also presents opportunities to enjoy some local cuisine. I do enjoy Indian food, but South Indian food tend to be quite spicy and it can be challenging to find food that agrees with my taste buds. I usually eat a lot of non-veg, but here in Kerala, there is so much diversity in vegetarian food that I would happily become a vegetarian.

The mountainous regions of Kerala, such as Idukki district is one my favourite destinations to escape the heat and pollution of cities. The route is scenic and if you are lucky, you might even get to see some wildlife as a lot of Idukki is part of the Western ghats nature reserve and national parks. This is also an ideal location for stargazing as there is minimal light pollution. As a plus, there tends to be less mosquitoes in the mountains.

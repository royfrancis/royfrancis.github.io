I had a few days off and took the opportunity to go on a short getaway to snowy winter wonderland. The snow in Uppsala and most of Stockholm and southern Sweden is rubbish. To find some, good quality snow, one needs to drive 5 hours west to Norway. Regions north of Mora and places such as Sälen and Stöten seem to have a decent quality snow. I stayed at an STF hostel called [Sälens Vandrarhem](https://www.salensvandrarhem.se/), close to Stöten. Nice, cozy place and the owner is a fun dude. At this time of the year, the hostel is literally empty and it was all mine. I drove a bit into Norway to the little town of Ljørdalen. The town centre is basically 2 houses, one of which is a supermarket and the other is a church. The snow in Norway is much nicer. Heavier and more consistent. The landscape is absolutely amazing.I also saw a whole herd of Moose wandering about. Unfortunately, they got away before I could get my camera. This place is excellent for winter photography.

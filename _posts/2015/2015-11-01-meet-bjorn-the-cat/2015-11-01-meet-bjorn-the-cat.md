This is Björn. He is a 6 month old [Norwegian Forest Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Forest_cat). Björn is energetic and playful. He is very fluffy and cuddly. He likes human company. He is one those strange cats that like belly rubs. His sleeping spot is the hammock on the play tower. But he can also be naughty around the house. Sometimes, he does go hyper and runs around the house. He attacks toilet paper rolls like there is no tomorrow. Sometimes he can be stupid enough to fall out through the window. Other times, he can be sharp enough to spot a fly on the window from meters away. He likes to help with the gardening. He also likes to help with things when not needed. But, he is generally good company to have around the house.

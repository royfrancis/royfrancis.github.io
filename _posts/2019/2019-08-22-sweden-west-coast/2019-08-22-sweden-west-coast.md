The west coast of Sweden is well known for it's [rocky archipelago](https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/vastsverige/west-coast-archipelago/) and scenic beauty. Also known for seafood, sea kayaking and floating saunas. I took a trip through Lidköping and Trollhättan to Lysekil, Fjällbacka and Grebbestad.

In Trollhättan, the [Saab car museum](https://saabcarmuseum.se/en/), Trollhättan canal and Olidan power station were interesting. About 30 mins north of Lysekil is the animal park [Nordens ark](https://nordensark.se/). It's a fun place if you are into animals.

I slowly drove around between Lysekil and Grebbestad stopping at every scenic spot. There are also many camping spots around the area which makes it convenient. I stayed at Fjällbacka camping for one of the nights was a really cute campsite with glorious views over the archipelago.

## Introduction

Honey bees (_Apis mellifera_ L.) play a vital role in terrestrial ecosystems by maintaining floral biodiversity and provide sustainable agriculture through pollination thereby ensuring food security. Honey bees are under constant threat by numerous pathogens and pests including bacteria, fungus, viruses, microsporideans, mites, insects, pesticides and environmental changes. The interactions among these along with possibly other unknown factors are causing widespread decline in honey bee populations across the planet. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is a recent phenomenon characterised by sudden disappearance of bees from the colony, which has perplexed beekeepers and researchers worldwide.

The single greatest threat to beekeeping is the recently introduced invasive mite _Varroa destructor_. In addition to the damage caused by feeding on the bees, the mites are also effective transmitters of viruses. Viral prevalence and virus related mortality has significantly risen following the rapid spread of varroa mites. Viruses are the most recent and still poorly understood pathogens of the honey bees. Varroa mites along with specific viruses have been suspected to play a major role in CCD.

One of the most important groups of viruses often associated with dwindling colonies is the ABPV-KBV-IAPV* complex (AKI). These are closely related viruses showing high genome similarity. While these three viruses are considered damaging to bee health, their prevalence in the Danish bee population is relatively low. Viral diagnosis of honey bee samples typically requires separate assays for each virus tested. A short stretch of sequence was identified in the genome which was conserved across the three viruses. Specially designed consensus primers (AKI primers) enabled the detection of these three different viruses in a single assay thus economising time and expense. Eighty-six different samples from several countries were tested using AKI primers and virus-specific primers to confirm the reliability of the primers.

## Spatial distribution of viruses in honey bee queens

[caption id="attachment_583" align="aligncenter" width="638"][![Spatial distribution of AKI and DWV viruses in honey bee queens.](http://www.roymfrancis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/queen-virus-medium-011-1024x441.png)](http://www.roymfrancis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/queen-virus-medium-011.png) Spatial distribution of AKI and DWV viruses in honey bee queens (n=86). (Left) shows the percentage of tested queens positive for a virus in a certain tissue. (Middle) shows the distribution of viral titres in each tissue. The vertical line denotes the median and the dot denotes the mean. (Right) shows queens showing infection in a single tissue.[/caption]

The health of the queen is critical for the well-being of the colony. Queen failure is often reported as a cause for colony losses by beekeepers. Although the queen is seldom reported to be sick, her role in intra-colony viral transmission is unknown. This study quantitatively investigated the distribution of viral infection in five tissues of 86 honey bee queens. Damaging viral infections in queens were generally low. Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) was highly prevalent in the queen tissues while AKI viruses were comparatively less prevalent. The thorax was found to be the most frequently infected tissue and the highest viral titre was found in the spermatheca. The ovaries showed the lowest viral titre and was the least frequently infected. Strand-specific analysis showed viral replication in all tissues. None of the tested queens showed any overt signs of disease.

## Varroa-virus interaction in honey bee colonies

[caption id="attachment_623" align="aligncenter" width="638"][![Sampling strategy for the Varroa-virus interaction experiment. About 200 worker bees were randomly collected from 11 organic acid treated colonies, 9 Flumethrin treated and 3 untreated colonies once a month for 8 months. The 200 bees were split into 10 sub-samples of 20 bees and tested for AKI and DWV titres using qRT-PCR.](http://www.roymfrancis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WExpSampling-04-1024x309.png)](http://www.roymfrancis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WExpSampling-04.png) Fig 3A: Sampling strategy for the Varroa-virus interaction experiment. About 200 worker bees were randomly collected from 11 organic acid treated colonies, 9 Flumethrin treated and 3 untreated colonies once a month for 8 months. The 200 bees were split into 10 sub-samples of 20 bees and tested for AKI and DWV titres using qRT-PCR.[/caption]

A large study was undertaken to create a comprehensive overview on the progression of viruses and mites over the course of a year (See Fig 3A). This study examined eight collections of 200 bees from 23 hives under three treatment conditions to reveal trends and patterns in viral infection of two bee viruses (AKI and DWV) including mite infestation. DWV was much more widespread than AKI all through the season (See Fig 3B). Titres of DWV were generally much higher than AKI. AKI peaks were observed in autumn.

Top labels show colonies and treatment groups: Organic (green), Flumethrin (red) and Untreated (blue). Left side labels show sampling month. Viral titres are shown as low (green), medium (yellow) and high (red). A sample from one colony for one month is split into 10 subsamples.[/caption]

Growth of varroa mites were suppressed by treatment, but viral titres still increased (Fig 3C). Untreated colonies showed higher mite and virus levels than treated colonies. High viral tires in mites correlated with high viral titres in worker bees.

Colonies that collapsed over the winter had significantly higher AKI and DWV titres in October compared to survivors.

Green colour denotes organic acid treated colonies, red is flumethrin-treated and blue are untreated colonies.[/caption]

Dying colonies had higher prevalence of diseased worker bees than surviving colonies. For AKI, only the dying colonies had greater than 1% infected workers in the hive.
